## Introduction
This project contains three implementations of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python, utilizing the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Each implementation offers a different gameplay experience:

### 1. 2-Player Tic Tac Toe (tictactoe-two-players.py): 
- Play against a friend locally on the same computer.
### 2. Tic Tac Toe vs. Random Bot (tictactoe-random.py): 
- Play against a bot that makes random moves.
### 3. Tic Tac Toe vs. AI using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning (tictactoe-ai.py): 
- Challenge an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal moves. Good luck trying to beat it.

## Dependencies
- tkinter: Comes natively included with standard installions of Python
- Pillow: `pip install Pillow`
- Random: Built in module in Python

## Usage
### 1. 2-Player Tic Tac Toe
- Player 1 starts as 'X' and Player 2 starts as 'O'
- Click on an empty cell to make a move
- The game will show a win screen when a player wins or a tie screen if a tie occurs
- Closing the win or tie screen resets the board and tracks the winner's score
### 2. Tic Tac Toe vs Random Bot
- You play as 'X' and the bot plays as 'O'
- Click on an empty cell to make a move
### 3. Tic Tac Toe vs AI Bot
